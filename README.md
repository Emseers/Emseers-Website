# Emseers-Website
## About
Website project for the Emseers, check it out at http://emseers.github.io/. The main objective behind this is a simple place to showcase Emseers content and blogs to the public.

The website is tried to be kept as simplistic as possible. On the main pages, there are Twitter and Blog widgets on either side, and the main content has TWO columns. The height for these pages is fixed. For blog pages, there are Twitter and Blog widgets on either side, and the main content has ONE column. The height for these pages is NOT fixed.

The website content width is dynamic, so more resolutions can be supported. The way this is currently done is the widths of most of the inner elements are calculated on the fly (depending on screen width), and the widths of the widgets are kept static. If the width of the page goes below a certain point, the Twitter and Blog widgets are collapsed. Please keep this in mind when you add content.

## Development
If you are planning to implement new features, content, etc., please create a new branch with the changes, then submit a pull request. To create a new main page, duplicate the template file, and use that as a starting point. New blog page instructions are in the readme in the blog folder. Feel free to create any issues as you see fit.
