## Development
To write a new blog entry:

1) Duplicate the blogTemplate file, and use that as a starting point
   - PLEASE make sure to host images on the Emseers Imgur account or elsewhere (NOT on the repo)
   - If you are using an already hosted image, please be considerate and rehost on Imgur

2) Add a new entry to the blogIndex file in the root of directory
